# KNP-EMI-DG

### About

Code for solving the KNP--EMI problem using a DG fem method.

### Dependencies code

All dependencies are listed in [environment.yml](./environment.yml).
To create an environment with these dependencies use either `conda` or `mamba` and run

```bash
conda env create -f environment.yml
```

or

```bash
mamba env create -f environment.yml
```

Then call

```bash
conda activate KNP-EMI
```

To install package run
```bash
python3 -m pip install -e .
```

### EMIx simulation
The directory EMIx_simulations contains an example where the DG code is used to
run an electrodiffusive simulation on realistic 3D geometries from the
EMIx-meshes.

The initial conditions for the PDE/ODE KNP-EMI system are calibrated by solving
an extended system of ODEs - see 

- mm_two_tags_calibration_ODE.py, and
- run_calibration_two_cells_ODE.py

for further details. The system is stimulated by an ECS injection of potassium.

### Geometry

The code assumes ECS cells are tagged with 0 and ICS cells are tagged with
1,2,3, ... and that all interior facets are tagged with 0. The membrane
potential is defined as phi_i - phi_e (i.e. phi_1 - phi_2). Since we have
marked cell in ECS with 0 and cells in ICS with 1 we have an interface
normal pointing inwards. In general, normals will always point from lower to
higher (e.g. from 0 -> 1)
